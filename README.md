# quittit-extension

A browser extension to enforce [quittit](https://github.com/itsmaxymoo/quittit-website)!

This extension aims to help you quit addictive websites by forcefully redirecting you
to quittit when you try to access them. You may add and remove your own sites to block
as well as modify the default list!

**Note:** currently, this extension behaves unpredictably with container tabs. It may
not block sites that run in container tabs.
